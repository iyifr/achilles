Vector databases are specialized systems designed to store and query high-dimensional vector representations of data.
These vectors, often called embeddings, capture the semantic meaning of text, images, or other data types.
Unlike traditional databases that match exact keywords, vector databases enable similarity search, finding items that are semantically close to a query.
This capability is crucial for applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for large language models.
GlowstickDB aims to provide a performant and flexible solution in this space.
FastEmbed is a lightweight, fast, Python library for embedding generation.
It supports various models and is designed for efficiency.
Combining these tools allows for powerful AI applications.
The core idea is to map data into a vector space where distance corresponds to similarity.
Common distance metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and dot product.
Efficient indexing algorithms like HNSW or IVF are used to speed up nearest neighbor search.
This text is being used to generate test data for the GlowstickDB project.
We need enough text to create multiple chunks with overlap.
Testing edge cases like short documents or very long ones is also important.
Metadata management is another key feature of vector databases, allowing filtering alongside vector search.
Transaction support ensures data integrity during updates and insertions.
Concurrency control is vital for high-throughput environments.
Persistence ensures data is not lost on restart.
WiredTiger is an underlying storage engine that can be used for such systems.
Go is a popular language for building high-performance database systems.
Python is widely used for data processing and AI tasks.
This ecosystem integration is what we are testing here.
