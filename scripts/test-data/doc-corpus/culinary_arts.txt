The art of fermentation is one of humanity's oldest culinary techniques, used to preserve food and enhance flavor.
From Korean kimchi and German sauerkraut to sourdough bread and yogurt, fermentation relies on beneficial microorganisms like bacteria and yeasts to transform ingredients.
These microbes break down sugars and starches, producing acids, alcohol, and gases that change the texture and taste of the food.
In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in artisanal fermentation, with chefs and home cooks experimenting with miso, kombucha, and garums.
Sourdough baking, in particular, gained massive popularity, with bakers nurturing wild yeast starters to create breads with complex flavor profiles and improved digestibility.
The process requires patience and attention to variables like temperature and humidity, making it as much a science as an art.
Fermented foods are also prized for their potential health benefits, as they often contain probiotics that support gut health.
Exploring the world of fermentation reveals the invisible biological processes that have shaped human diets for millennia.
